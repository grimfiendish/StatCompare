What are the 'itemsocre' references? i think they're supposed to be 'itemscore' but even so there's no ItemScore  either...
what are the 'S_ItemTip' references? i only see checks for if it exists and no reference to it being created. I have, what, five? child addons to this addon and still finding orphaned code...
does 'DressOn' / 'DressOff' work now?
what does 'oSkin' and 'Skinner' addon refer to?
